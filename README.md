## Introduction

This project was built using ReactJs, ReactRouter, Styled-Components, react-toastify, and
react parser to analyze some of the data from our API.

to get Started please clone this repo, and type yarn install in your terminal.
right after you'll be able to run it using ===> yarn start. (my favorite command :))

A few words: this project presents the user different kinds of security breaches using an endpoint and a header,
using my favorite Pokemon Charizard.
Right after you can read about each threat and get into their personal website to get more details 
regarding the matter.
